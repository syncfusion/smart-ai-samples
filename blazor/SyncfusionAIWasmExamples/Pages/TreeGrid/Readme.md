# Syncfusion Tree Grid - Adaptive Structuring

## Overview

This demo highlights the use of AI to structure and correct erroneous hierarchical data within the **Tree Grid** component, ensuring proper organization and display.

### AI-Powered Adaptive Structuring

The AI-powered prompt identifies and organizes data items into a hierarchical format by accurately establishing parent-child relationships. This ensures that data is correctly nested and ready for display in the Tree Grid component, making it an essential tool for visualizing structured datasets.

## Features

- **AI-Prompted Structuring**: Automatically identifies and organizes data into a hierarchical structure.
- **Error Correction**: Adjusts any misassigned relationships to ensure accurate parent-child associations.
- **Tree Grid Display**: Displays properly nested data in a coherent, structured manner.

## How It Works

Using a specialized AI prompt, the system scans the dataset to identify and restructure hierarchical relationships between records. Any misassigned relationships are corrected by adjusting the **ParentId** fields to align with their respective **CategoryId**. Once the dataset is properly organized, it is bound to the Tree Grid for an accurate and coherent display.
