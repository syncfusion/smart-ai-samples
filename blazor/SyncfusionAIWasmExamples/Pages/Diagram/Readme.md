# Syncfusion Blazor Diagram - AI Samples

# Diagram Component - MindMap

## Overview

This demo showcases the creation of a dynamic **MindMap Diagram** using the **Blazor Diagram Component** with AI assistance. The mindmap features nodes and connectors arranged in a layout that visually organizes and represents ideas and concepts. It's a powerful tool for brainstorming, organizing thoughts, and mapping out complex information visually.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Generation**: Automatically creates mindmap diagrams based on AI-generated content.
- **Interactive Nodes**: Add, edit, or delete nodes through the context menu for flexible diagram management.
- **Customization**: Users can manually add child nodes to further expand and personalize the mindmap.

## How It Works

This sample leverages a specialized AI prompt that allows users to generate the mindmap content by submitting a request to OpenAI. The AI response is parsed and transformed into nodes and connectors, visually representing the ideas or concepts in a mindmap format. Additionally, users can manually add child nodes using user handles, creating an interactive and customized mindmap experience.
