# Syncfusion Blazor Query Builder - Natural Language Querying

## Overview

The **Natural Language Querying** feature in the Query Builder allows users to construct complex queries using plain, everyday language. Instead of relying on technical query syntax, users can simply type their questions or requests as they would naturally speak them. This feature interprets the intent and generates the corresponding query, making data retrieval more accessible to non-technical users.

## Features

- **Plain Language Input**: Users can type queries as they would naturally speak.
- **Intent Interpretation**: The system interprets user intent and generates the appropriate query.
- **Simplified Data Retrieval**: Allows users to obtain insights without needing to understand complex query syntax.

## How It Works

The **Natural Language Querying** feature enables users to input queries in plain language. The system then interprets these queries and automatically generates the corresponding database queries. This approach simplifies data retrieval, making it easier for users to obtain insights without needing to be familiar with technical query syntax.
