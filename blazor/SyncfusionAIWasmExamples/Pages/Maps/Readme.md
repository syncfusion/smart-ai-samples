# Syncfusion Blazor Maps - Weather Forecast

## Overview

This sample demonstrates the integration of AI to forecast weather conditions in the United States for the next five days using marker templates in the **Syncfusion Blazor Maps** component. The AI-generated forecasts are visualized through the Maps component, providing users with up-to-date weather predictions.

## Features

- **Weather Forecast**: AI predicts weather conditions for the next five days.
- **Marker Templates**: Displays weather forecasts on the map using marker templates.
- **Dynamic Visualization**: Integrates real-time weather data with the Blazor Maps component.

## How It Works

In this sample, users can view weather predictions for the next five days provided by AI. The data is then converted into a source for the [`MapsMarker`](https://help.syncfusion.com/cr/blazor/Syncfusion.Blazor.Maps.MapsMarker-1.html), which renders the weather forecasts as marker templates in the **Syncfusion Blazor Maps** component.
