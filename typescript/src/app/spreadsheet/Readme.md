## Sample Description

This sample demonstrates the integration of AI into a spreadsheet application to enhance user productivity and streamline complex tasks. The AI capabilities are utilized to automatically analyze the content of the spreadsheet, generate appropriate formulas based on the data, and validate these formulas for accuracy. The solution helps users save time and reduce human error by automating the process of creating and validating formulas, providing a seamless and intelligent way to handle large amounts of data.



## Action Description

* Content Analysis: The AI scans the spreadsheet's data, identifying patterns and structures in the cells.
* Formula Generation: Based on the analyzed data, the AI automatically generates relevant formulas to perform calculations or operations that match the identified patterns.
* Formula Validation: The generated formulas are validated by the AI to ensure correctness, preventing mistakes like miscalculations or invalid references.
* Error Handling: If any issues are detected in the formulas, the AI provides feedback and suggestions to fix the errors.
* User Interaction: Users can review and accept the generated formulas or make adjustments as needed, while the AI continues to assist in refining the formulas for optimal accuracy.interfaces.
